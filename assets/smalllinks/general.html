        <h1>General Information</h1>
        
        <h2>Shipping and Delivery - Delivery Zones</h2>
        <p>Products will be shipped to the delivery address(es) specified during the ordering procedure, provided such address(es) are located within the Delivery Zone. Any delivery address located outside of the Delivery Zone will be refused during the ordering procedure. Products purchased via the Website may only be delivered to a physical street address within the Delivery Zone. STS will not process any order for which a post office box or APO/FPO address is provided.</p>
        
        <h2>Returns, Replacements & Exchanges</h2>
        <p>With the exception of certain specialty items and/or customized items, you may return any product ordered on the Website for an exact replacement or refund within thirty (30) calendar days from the delivery date, subject to the terms and limitations set out below. Returned products must be in their perfectly saleable, original condition and, if applicable, packaging, together with their purchase invoice or a copy in the case of a partial return. STS has sole discretion in determining whether the products purchased via the Website are in original condition when returned. Returning a product for an exact replacement or refund is free of charge as long as you return the products to us via our carrier by using our system of pre-paid return labels. Contact Customer Service to request a return or exact replacement. Customer Service will provide instructions to complete your return.</p>
        
        <h3>Returns Conditions Applicable to Specific Products</h3>
        <p>Items such as fragrance, makeup, and beauty products must not be opened and must be returned in their original packaging. If the transparent film has been opened or removed, or if the product has been used, the item will not be accepted for return or exchange. If a product is defective or has been damaged during delivery, the customer must ensure that the product is still sealed and report the issue to Customer Service.</p>
        
        <h3>Exact Replacement and Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>You may exchange an item for the exact replacement of that item, which may vary by size if applicable. If you replace an item for another item of greater value due to size or configuration, you shall pay the difference in price. If you request an exact replacement for an item of lesser value due to size or configuration, you will be refunded within ten (10) business days of receipt of the item returned by crediting your debit or credit card. Please contact Customer Service to receive the return instructions. If you replace an item, the shipping costs for the first delivery will not be refunded. However, you will not be charged for the shipping costs of the second delivery. Only one exact replacement per item will be honored.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Slavery Act 2018 Compliance</h2>
        <p>STS is committed to complying with the Modern Slavery Act 2018, which is a key piece of legislation in Australia aimed at combatting modern slavery in all its forms.

We conduct due diligence on our suppliers and partners, require adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and provide training to our staff on identifying and preventing modern slavery. We believe in transparency and encourage all employees, partners, and suppliers to report any concerns regarding potential modern slavery issues. Reports can be made confidentially and without fear of retaliation. We are dedicated to continuously improving our policies and practices in this area to ensure compliance with the Act and uphold our commitment to ethical business conduct.</p>
