We reserve the right to revise and amend these terms at any time without prior notice. You are expected to check this page regularly to take notice of any changes we may have made, as they are binding on you. Certain provisions of these terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of this website. Failure to enforce any of these terms will not be deemed a waiver of that term or any other term.
